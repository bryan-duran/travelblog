        My name is Bryan and something I enjoy doing is travelling the world.
        From the bustling streets of New York City, <br />
        to the historical alleys and circuses of London, I'm here to tell you
        all about what you can find, do, and experience around the world!

          One of the many questions people ask is "Which city is the best to
          visit?" In short, there is no viable answer as every city is beautiful
          and unique in its own way. Besides, every person will always have a
          different answer because everyone has their own interests that makes a
          city "the best" to them. Some people enjoy a fast-paced setting and
          will prefer locations like NYC, others enjoy a chic setting like Paris
          where fashion, business, and history can come together. Some might
          also enjoy places that have a blend of cultures like Mexico City,
          where Indigenous and European culture blended (though sometimes
          forcefully) to create beautiful architecture, food, language, and a
          new mixed culture that many still practice. In the end, it really all
          depends on what you like and what interest you that can make a foreign
          city feel like a new home to you.
